## What Is an Annotated Bibliography?

An annotated bibliography is a list of citations to books, articles, and other resources that are relevant to your research topic. Each citation is followed by a brief summary or evaluation of the resource. The purpose of an annotated bibliography is to give readers an overview of the sources you have consulted in your research and to demonstrate the quality and relevance of these sources. The annotations also provide insights into how the source fits into your work.
